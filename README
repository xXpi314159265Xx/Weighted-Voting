## Weighted Voting

This repository takes a weighted voting system and produces either the Banzhaf Power Index or the Shapley-Shubik Power Index.

### Using the files

For each file you need the following system:

[quota: player_1_weight, player_2_weight, player_3_weight,...]

Both the Banzhaf and Shapley-Shubik methods ask for the quota, the number of players in the system and the weights for each player.
